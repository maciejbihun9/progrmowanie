 * use the smallest data type for columns to make sure that index will be the fastest on the database,

 * avoid writting a lot of many-to-many associations,
 - never write many-to-many mappings with a list, Hibernate handles
 the removal of associated entities very inefficiently,

 * List and Bug is mapped to java.util.List, so if you use a list
 without specifying an order, you are using Bug.
 - this is the expected behaviour, because ordering slows down a query,
