 * keep in mind that each pymongo query returns Cursor and do not load any data from the database,
   you have to do something with the data to get it np.:
 - list(cursor) - get all items from the database
 - cursor.find_one() - load one item  - but maybe it won't work
 - when you have list of items in the Cursor then iterate over cursor - it will load one item at the time
 - for one item it can be list()
