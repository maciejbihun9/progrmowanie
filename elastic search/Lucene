BASICS:

 * this is a high-performance full text search engine:

HOW IT WORKS:

 * quickly finds all words in given table,

 * text-index stores info about all stored terms in given table,

 * full text search uses all available search methods in sql,

 * this index is not the same as text-index,

 * an index is associated with all terms
 and this is called text-index
