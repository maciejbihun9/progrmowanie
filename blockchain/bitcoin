 * table that contains names - balances,

 * anyone has the same copy of this file and
 anyone can see those balances, but those balances are linked with hashes,
 so that is why the basic level of anonymity is maintained,

 * when transaction is made then i am broadcasting a message about the transaction details
 to everyone around me so they can update their accounts,

 * a person does not has to be a host for those ledgers,

 * anybody has a private key, that is used with transaction message to create a signature.
 This signature is unique for each transaction. People in Bitcoin community are allowed to
 verify each transaction using you public key.

 * all transactions goes to a pending area. Miners gets those transactions from that area and
 tries to generate a number that produces relevant hash number out of it that is acceptable by a system.
 Once this code is generated then this transaction go to a chain
