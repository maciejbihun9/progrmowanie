 * visual studio contains it's own

 * partial view:
 - during the views creation I can create a partial view,
 - this is a widget of a complete page,
 - this is not a complete page

 * views associated with url:
 - each view folder should have the same name as url ending
 - we should even create folder structure if want to have extended url system
 - after url is called the browser should call for an Index.html view
