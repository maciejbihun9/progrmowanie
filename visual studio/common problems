 * Angular modules not found during build process:
 - it is possible that I closed laptop during node_modules downloading process,
 - check the node_modules folder
 - clean all solution, try restart visual studio or even a laptop to clear all soltion,
 then build once again, it helps!!!

 * changes are not visible by browser:
 - if everything seems to be working and after some change it starts to not working then
 and after that change removal it is not seems to be right then starts to be crazy,
