 * update only one package:
 (if you do npm install it will reinstall and reindex all packages, so it might take a lot of time)
 - npm install package_name@version (even if already exists),

 * removing node_modules:
 - it takes so long, 30 mins, so be sure that there is no other way to do it (it means for visual studio of course!)
 i think for VS env,
 - we can remove all modules just by just replacingn them between folders, it works!

 * use only cmd for getting packages, but for folder only, to get packages in the project we have to make sure
 that we restore packages in the project also because of installation on the vs server,
