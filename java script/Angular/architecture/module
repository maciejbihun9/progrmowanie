 * WE SHOULD CREATE MANY SUBTREES THAT ARE DECLARED IN ONE MODULE,
 THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CAN USE THIS ENTIRE MODULE IN OTHER APPLICATIONS

 * we can have many modules across entire application and we should, Each module should
 contain components associated with only one feature where we can have modules that
 declares components that can be used accros entire application,

 * An NgModule is a container for a cohesive
 block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow,
 or a closely related set of capabilities.
 - so in one module we should have components related by use cases,
 that imports functionality from other modules
 - every app has at least one module
 - You launch your app by bootstrapping the root NgModule.
 - we can have many NgModules that contains many related components,
 - Only the root NgModule should set this bootstrap property,
 - we do not have to write export in AppModule, because we won't need
 to export entire module anywhere,

 * providers are accessible in entire application,

 * exports - defines what other modules can see,

 * imports - defines what our main module can see from other modules,

 * in main.ts we can bootstrap many modules that instantly becomes rootModules
 in which we can bootstrap some our components,

 * A component and its template together define a view.

 * we can have many components that are host components for many sub components
 and those all components can be in one ngModule, but it is does not have
 to be like that.
