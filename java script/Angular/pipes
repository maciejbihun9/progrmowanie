 * Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts,
 dates and other display data.
 Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.

 * create json from a object:
 - {{ user | json }}
 
 * parse to uppercase:
 - {{ hero.name | uppercase }}

 * asynchromus refreshing items from subscribed Subject:
 - heroes$ - reference to subscribed subject
 - <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async">
