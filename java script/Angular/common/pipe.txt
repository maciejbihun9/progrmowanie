 * convert objects into json representation:
 - object: Object = {foo: 'bar', baz: 'qux', nested: {xyz: 3, numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}};
 - {{object | json}}
 
 * convert letter to upper representation:
 - {{string | uppercase}}
 
 * convert string into lower case representation:
 - {{string | uppercase}}
 
asyncPipe:

 * allows me to get the data from an observable without calling any subscription
 methods
 
 * just call {{observable | async}}
 
 * this also allows us to work with an observable without unsubscribing it!,
 - this is a great feature because we do not have to implement any
 ngOnDestroy methods, this is a great feature and that is it,
 
 * i do not think that I can use an observable in the normal web service, because
 this observable is called only once where in the examples they use an observable 
 that is called many times, so i can not see the results of the operaionts,
