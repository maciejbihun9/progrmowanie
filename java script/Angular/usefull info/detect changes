 * Angular is able to check milions of bidings in miliseconds,

 * each component has it's own change detector,

 * after each change in one change detector angular runs all change detectors,

 * change detector checks bindings:
 - {{ name }}, [name]=‚Äùuser.name"

 * change detection is made after each:
 - http call,
 - after each button click,
 - after each event (keystroke, mouseclick, mousemove)

 * it does not matter where asynchromus call was made,
 change detection starts on the top of the tree,

 examples:

 * we can add many many items to our list that is an input parameter
 in a component that has ChangeDetectionRef.onPush and change detection
 will not be called until we call it,

 - then will be called only a subtree
