 * we should create models as interfaces and put them into one file called interface,

 * an interfacae is just for compile time checking,

 * a class will be available on runtime so you can define methods in it,
 that you can call, but you have to create instances of it.

EXAMPLES:

 * export interface Model {
    name: string;
    surname: string;
    age: number;
    address?: string // it is optional, so we can skip it in creation of new instances
 }

 * create an object:
 - let model: Model = {
    name: "Maciej",
    surname: "Bihun",
    age: 23
 }
