 * use async pipe to do it,

 * async pipe subscribes to an observable automatically,

 * change detection is fired only after reference change,
 growing collections can not force it to do a job

 * async pipe unsubscribes from observable everytime
 a component is destroyed and reference changes,
 so creating a subscription reference is not needed
 and this protects us from memory leaks,
 - saying that it is really important to note that adding a new item to it does not changes it's reference

 * use changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush change
 detection strategy when playing with async pipe, because when we pass
 an observable to a component with it, async pipe will detect change in growing list
 even if reference was ont changed

 * it is a pure gold for managing async tasks
