 * services are a great way to fetch the data!!!

 * we can inject service into service
 
 * if we want to bind a service in to a template then it have to pe public,
 
 * we can call services methods in the html code,
 -  <button (click)="this.messageService.consoleInfo(heroSurname.value); heroSurname.value = ''">
 
 * service should be injected in the constructor,

 * create a service component:
 - ng generate service hero
 
 * simple service example:
 - @Injectable()
   export class Mock {
        mike = new Person(1, 'Mike', 'mike@gmail');
        constructor() { }
    }

 * Injectable() - zapewnia, że pozostałe moduły także zostaną wstrzyknięte dalej
 
 * Each service should be declared in app.module providers
 - in the providers list we have all singleton objects that are 
   shared by all modules and objects.
 - we do not have to declare them in other places  

 * do not load data in the constructor, because it can be time consuming
  
 * services are perfect place for managing the data, messages from the application.
