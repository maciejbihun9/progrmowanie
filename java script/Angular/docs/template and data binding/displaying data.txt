 * More precisely, the redisplay occurs after some kind
 of asynchronous event related to the view, such as a keystroke,
 a timer completion, or a response to an HTTP request,
 
 * when you declare a html tag with selector name in it then Angular
 detecs it and creates an instance of it in the application,
 
 * it is better to instantiate a variable with a constructor,
 
 * we can generate a new class typing -:):
 - ng generate class hero
 
 * declare a simple class with some initial properties:
 - Declares a constructor parameter and its type.
 - Declares a public property of the same name.
 - Initializes that property with the corresponding 
 argument when creating an instance of the class.
 - export class Hero {
  constructor(
    public id: number,
    public name: string) { }
 }
