 * subscribe to couple observables and get only last items from each stream
    - if one fails all response fails
    public forkJoinTest(): Observable<any>{
          const example = forkJoin(
            //emit 'Hello' immediately
            of('Hello'),
            //emit 'World' after 1 second
            of('World').pipe(delay(4000)),
            //emit 0 after 1 second
            interval(1000).pipe(take(1)),
            //emit 0...1 in 1 second interval
            interval(1000).pipe(take(2)),
            //promise that resolves to 'Promise Resolved' after 5 seconds
          );
      //output: ["Hello", "World", 0, 1, "Promise Resolved: RESULT"]
          return example;
        }

      - it will return: Hello, World, 0, 1 after 4 seconds when all responses are ready to be displayed
