 * we should create models as interfaces and put them into one file called interface,

EXAMPLES:

 * export interface Model{
    name: string;
    surname: string;
    age: number;
    address?: string // it is optional, so we can skip it in creation of new instances
 }

 * let model: Model = {
    name: "Maciej",
    surname: "Bihun",
    age: 23
 }
