 * use ng-container to place na html content without host element
 - <p>
     I turned the corner
     <ng-container *ngIf="hero">
       and saw {{hero.name}}. I waved
     </ng-container>
     and continued on my way.
   </p>

 * It's more like the curly braces in a JavaScript if-block:
 - if (someCondition) {
     statement1;
     statement2;
     statement3;
   }
