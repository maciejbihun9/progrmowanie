 * every single time a list is changed (new item added, removed) the list is changed
 and this might cause not efficient behaviour on the template side, because
 Angular might invoke cascade DOM change.
 - this works especially well when we get from the server items with the same id's
 but if we get items with totally different id's then we might end up with pour performance.

 * <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes; trackBy: trackByHeroes">
     ({{hero.id}}) {{hero.name}}
   </div>

 * trackByHeroes(index: number, hero: Hero): number { return hero.id; }
