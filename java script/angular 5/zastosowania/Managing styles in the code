 * append class and styles to a html element in the same time:
 - <input [class.direction]="this.column.isHidden" [style.top]="tabMargin()" (click)="closeColumn()" type="image" src="../../../assets/right_arrow.png" id="hide-column-btn" />

 * append a class with HostBinding:
 - using this you have to provide scss file for styles, because we can not
 add a class to a host without that:
 - this is very common case when developing applications

 - :host {
  &.simple-class {
      color: red;
  }
 }

 - @HostBinding('class.simple-class')
 get isMultiClickSelection(): boolean {
       return true;
 }
