 * firstly constructor is created, after that all other methods
 are called,
 - it is not possible to use input variables in the constructor,
 because they are not available there yet,

 * ngOnChanges() - is called before ngOnInit(),
 - this method contains SimpleChanges object with previouds and current data,
 - calls each time when an input variable is changed,
 - this is the first place where you can get those input parameters,

 * ngOnInit() - called only once
 - To perform complex initializations shortly after construction.
 - To set up the component after Angular sets the input properties.
 - greate place for initial data,
 - in this moment all input data-bounded properties are initialized
