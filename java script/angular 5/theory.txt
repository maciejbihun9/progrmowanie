 * In angular we have Services and Components,
 
 * From that image we can highlight some key points to master the framework. They are::
 - Module - this is like a class
 - Component - DOM in never touched when we changing the angular 2 componennts visibility,
   we use *ngIf directive to do that.
   We have to always think about Angular 2 components when we developing an application.
 - Template
 - Metadata
 - Service - service should only provide data for a application.
   Each service uses @Injectable() annotation to tell that this is a service
   that provides a data.
 - Directives
 - Dependency injection:
 An injected class is globally available to the application.
 We should declare our injected classes in the provides section of the app module.
 
 * So classes are considered as modules,
 
 * When many classes are created for just one module, it is called a Library,
 
 * databinding:
 - it is very important to know that {{}} will work for databinding between tags and 
   also in html tags attributes.
 - <img src="{{heroImageUrl}}" style="height:{{App.Style.Height}}">
 - we can also call methods on this objects:
 - {{object.method()}}
 
 *ngFor can be used even <tr>, <li> tags: 
 <tr *ngFor="#v of videos" (click)="onSelect(v)">
   <td> item1 </td>
   <td> item2 </td>
 </tr>
 
 *
