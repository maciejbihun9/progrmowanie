 * sometimes there can be some issues, errors in the compiler during using this,

 * import obserables:
 - import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';
 - import { of } from 'rxjs/observable/of';
 - import { map, filter, tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

 * create a set of obserbables:
 - myObs3 = Observable.of(12, 13, 14);
 - after subscribe we will have the results of three subscriptions
 
 * create only one obserbable for an array:
 - here we have only one subscription,
 - myObs2 = Observable.from([12,13,14]);
 
 * I assume that in the pipe method the returned data is exausted!!!
 - so there won't be any data results in the subscribe method,

 * 
 - ngOnInit() {
    this.myObs
	  // pipe can split items from an array into a stream of items
      .pipe(
		// tap replaced the do method
        tap(x => console.log('The do operator is now tap!')),
		// return only items that matches given if statement
        filter(x => x.length > 8),
		// map each item with this method
        map(x => x.toUpperCase())
      )
      .subscribe(x => console.log(x));
  }
