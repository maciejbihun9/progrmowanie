 * An Angular best practice is to load and configure the router in a separate, top-level module that is dedicated to routing and
 imported by the root AppModule.
 - ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app,
 
 * You generally don't declare components in a routing module,
 
 * Exporting RouterModule makes router directives available for use 
 in the AppModule components that will need them,
 
 * You first must initialize the router and start 
 it listening for browser location changes,
 
 * router outlet is declared in the highest component of the application,

 * import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
 - controls route parameters passed from higher html
 - this returns observable so we have to use subscribe
 
 * get params from url in the component:
 - this.route.params.subscribe(params => this.heroService.getHero(+(params['id']))
 .subscribe(hero => this.hero = hero));
