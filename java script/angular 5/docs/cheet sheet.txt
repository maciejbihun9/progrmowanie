We can find there all Angular tricks: 
 
 * exports - List of components, directives, and pipes visible to modules that import this module,
 
 * bootstrap - List of components to bootstrap when this module is bootstrapped.
 - so we can have many components that can be bootstrapped,
 - in the index.html we can declare many components that can be dispalyed
 at the application start
 - we can not do it without declaring in the bootstrap,
 
 * send an event to the method:
 - <button (click)="readRainbow($event)">,
 
 * acuire access to all html item action, attributes:
 - <video #movieplayer ...>
	<button (click)="movieplayer.play()">
   </video>
   
 * turns an html element into an embedded template:
 - <p *myUnless="myExpression">...</p>
 - this is equvalent to <ng-template></ng-template> 
 
 * ignore the rest of expression if first part is not available:
 - <p>Employer: {{employer?.companyName}}</p>
