 * each provider declared in the app.module is a singleton for entire application
 that lives all the time,
 
 * if you declared a service in a providers for one component then this is just scoped provider
 that is destroyed when this component dies,
 - then there can be many services,
 
 * use @Injectable() for each proveider because this is a coding style and
 tells Angular that this service  can have many injected providers itself,
