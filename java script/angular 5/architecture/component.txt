 * Angular creates, updates, and destroys components as the
 user moves through the application. Your app can take action at each moment in this
 lifecycle through optional lifecycle hooks, like ngOnInit().

 * a component is also a directive!!!, but component has it's own template

 * we define sub trees in html files,

 * any experienced jquery developer can experience many tidous code when working with
 data binding with the view

 * we have data binding from component to the template, we define data
 connection between those items in the component,

 * events - this is a method for callling components functions interacting with a view,
