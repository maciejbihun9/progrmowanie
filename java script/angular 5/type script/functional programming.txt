 * this is not just a shorter way to declare functions,

 * this also resolves problem of using "this" in the functions body:
 - let obj = {
       name: "Maciej",
       printName: function (){ setTimeout(() => {console.log(this.name)}, 1000)}
     };

 * in type script they introduced a new approach for working with functions:
 - array.forEach(x => console.log(x)) is the same as ...
 - array.forEach(function(x){console.log(x)})
