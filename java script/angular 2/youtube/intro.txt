 * it is very modular,
 
 * install much needed modules for a project(in the project directory):
 - npm install
 
 * compile files and start light server and recompile changes:
 - npm start
  
 * server will work on localhost:8000 
 
 * compile files goes to app folder,
 - we do not touch that
 
 * assets - for css files that are complierd into src/css files

 * we will work in the dev folder (create it by your self) 
 
 * boot.ts starts all our application,
 
 * node_modules contains all modules and dependencies,
 
 * each angular 2 applications have only one root component,
 
 * boot.ts (in our life this is ngModule!!!) - this is the first file that is executed in the first place,
 
 * there is a only one html file comes from a server into our  
   browser and then we manipulate that html file in our angular application,

 * the angular 2 server process should be terminated before closing the IDE,
   you can stop the process using info from here:
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39091735/port-4200-is-already-in-use-when-running-the-ng-serve-command
 
 * even after some fixes, there is no info about what should be fixed,
   because the program is still broken and there is no new info about a situation,
   
 * all errors are in browser!!!,

 * coping all files it is not good idea, a lot of change implementations there, 

INDEX.HTML
   
 * in main html file we have to import all used java script files,

 * we incluse our components into a html code:
 - <comp></comp>

 * import here boot file to boot all components
