use forms:

 * use inputs inside of form tags because this is semantically correct,

 * forms allow us to send the data to the server without AJAX and js,

 * if your intent is to send the data then you should use forms (for inputs),

 * use forms when you want to give a user the ability to send the data even
 when js is turned off,
