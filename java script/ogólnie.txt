BASICS:

 * podczas dodawania kodu do strony nale¿y uwa¿aæ na wszystkie komentarze oraz
cudzys³owie, bo mog¹ zostaæ Ÿle interpretowane przez przegl¹darke i bêdzie dupa,

 * CORS - allows to call Ajax requests to servers under other domains,
 we can get the resources from other servers,
 - this is the recomended idea for cracking the cross-domain concept,
 - here some additional informations are added to the headers of the requests,

 * web does not allows users to get page content from other domains
 eg. we can not get images from other domains using <img> src, this is dangerous!
 
URL/URI:

 * encode a url - this encodes only only the special characters of the url:
 - I have to encode them, because the special characters will be tract badly
 - var uri = "https://w3schools.com/my test.asp?name=stale&car=saab";
 - var res = encodeURIComponent(uri); 
 - from res i get the encoded url

COOKIES:

 * we receive cookies from the server and then we can use it around the whole application,
 
 * it is very usefull to pass the application states between app stages,
 
 * server can send a cookie with data access informations to the client,
 
 * are very fuckin important and we can not interact with the websites without them!!!,
 
 * server could not know whether the requestes are coming to the server from the same browser oraz
 not, so each request was tract the same wothout any knowledge about it,
 
 * cookie is saved on the client side computer/machine and is sended back and fourth,
 this cookie is set after the user authentication, this is just a data,
 
 * only cookie velue is sent over the web,
 Cookie: value,
 
 * they say that cookie file is encoded from url!!!, very strange for me, because I thought that
 we have to use all credentials to store some values or informations there,

 * with the first response to the client, the server sends this cookie,
 
 * cookies lives only when the browser is opened, and they die when is closed,
 
 * Without the expires option, a cookie has a lifespan of a single session,
 
 * when cookie has an expire date set to older than today date then it is removed right away,
 
 * the browser sends cookies only to sites that matches the domain names,
 but can be used also for paths. Those paths are chacked after the domain option has been checked,
 
 * we can also specify: secure flag, that allows the browser to send calls only over the https cpnecciton,
 because the clear text of the cookie would not be safe to send,
 
 * it is not safe to store the data in the cookies, because it is not safe at all,
 
 * the user changes the cookie names, to change teh cookie value we have to send set-cookie again,
 also with the same domain,
 
 * we can indentify cookie only by name!
 
 * we can delete a cookie by setting his date to the date in the past,
 
 * one domain can have only 20 cookies, and one cookie is restricted to have only 4kB,,
 
 * istnieje równie¿ koncept plików subcookie,
 
 * document.cookie has to be set unchangeable
 if you want to be sure that it won't be changed,
 
 * we can easly read data from cookies,

COOKIE-BASED XSRF PROTECTION SYSTEM: 

 * to be implemented
