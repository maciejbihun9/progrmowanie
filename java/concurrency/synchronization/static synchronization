 * public static synchronized int getCount(){ return 12; }
 - this method is synchronized on a class in which this method exists,
 so we can not invoke different static methods out of the same class by different threads,

 * use static synchronization to have only one property for all instances (I would use singleton here):
 private static boolean stopRequested;
 private static synchronized void requestStop() {
 stopRequested = true;
 }
 private static synchronized boolean stopRequested() {
 return stopRequested;
 }
