 * used for sending messages asynchromusly,

 how it works:

 * publisher publishes messages to a topic where subscribers gets these new data from a topic (one to many communication),

 * publisher publishes messages to a queue and receiver gets items from this queue (one to one communication),

 * many publishers publishes messages to a queue and receiver gets items from this queue (many to one communication)

 use cases:

 * it can be used to communicate between different application (spring boot applications, simple java applications),

 * it can be used send messages between applications, but what is more important it can happen without pinging (checking for new messages)

 * microservices use this mechanism to communicate between themselves
