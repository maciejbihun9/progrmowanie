 how to use:

 * MessageChannel

 * Message<T>

 worth to note:

 * it is basing on event driven architecture,

 * it is based on spring-cloud-stream (rapid pace of delivery and evolvment),

 * we do not have to think about these middleware stuff,
 we do not have to think about how message broker works (rabbitMQ, cafca)

 * applications communicate through channels,

 * we can have even group of competing customers where only one
 wins and makes a request to the server,

 * we do not have to add cafca or RabbitMQ,
 because spring cloud stream gives us that abstraction,

 * we do not have to add any broker specific code to our application!!!,

 considerations:

 * loose coupling,

 * it is common that it is done by many people, experts in their fields

 * it is easy to end up with to tightly coupled system that is fragile,

 * make sure to not over engeener that concept,

 message driven micro services apps:

 * we use for that spring cloud stream
