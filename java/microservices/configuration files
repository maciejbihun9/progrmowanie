 * bootstrap.properties is executed before application.properties, so
 there should be uri and profile settings

 * config files should be placed in git repo and should be pulled
 from there using this property:
 - spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost

 * this config .properties file can be replaced by .yml

 * file path does not matter if files exists in the resources folder,
 - http://localhost:8888/<file.properties name>/<profile name>

 providing configuration files for many environments,

 * one folder for QA, DEV, PROD envs
