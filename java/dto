BASIC INFO:

 * the main purpose why the dto was introduced was to limit web services calls to receive the data,

 * using this object can reduce many calls to one that gets data that specific application may need,

 * define only fields that you may need,

 * should not contain any business logic,

 * developers says that this is an anti-pattern for applications,
 and should be used only for complex data, complex applications,

 * developers uses JsonObject instead of dto objects,

BENEFITS:

 * I won't need @JsonIgnore and XmlTransient annotations,
