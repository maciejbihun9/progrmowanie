STRATEGY #1 - TDD APPROACH:

 description:

 * speed does not matter, only quality really matters,

 * this is a strategy only for me, to speed up a process of development,

 * I go to the test class and I see that I have left some comments and
 I know right away that there is still something to test,

 * when test method is ok then I remove comments,

 * when I look into test classes and see that there is no comments then I know that this test class is ok,

 steps:

 * write a method definition with parameters,

 * write comments for one method but for all cases that might happen in that method,

 * write test methods under each comment,

 * each test method will have their own test scope,

STRATEGY #2 - IMMUTABILITY APPROACH:

 description:

 * try to avoid allowing users to change already created objects,
