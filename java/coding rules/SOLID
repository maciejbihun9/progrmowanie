 * Main principles:
 - Find and define the actors.
 - Identify the responsibilities that serve those actors.
 - Group our functions and classes so that each has only one allocated responsibility.

 * To keep our primary value high, we must have a design that is easy to change,
  to extend, to accommodate new functionalities and to ensure that SRP is respected.

 * Single responsibility:
 - do not mix business logic with presentation !!! - very important,
 - one actor, one responsibility (librarier, Content management system)
 - always think about the actors that might
 that might be involved in operating the book,

 questions:

 * when the single responsibility principle might be broken?:
 - when field (like location) is not used by all actors, but some of them
 might be looking only to read the first page, know about the author,
 where a librarian might care about finding that book and delivering it to a user,
