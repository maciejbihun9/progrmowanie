 * this is a repository for dependencies of a project,

 * works with Maven in the same project as a proxy,
 - when Maven builds a project based on deps, Nexus just stores them,

 * So, when you want to use both you will have a repository managed by Nexus and Maven will access this repository,

 * we should query nexus for deps, we should maintain all deps there and
 query for deps to maven only if we do not have those in our Nexus repository,
