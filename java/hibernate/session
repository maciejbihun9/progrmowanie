BASIC INFORMATION:

 * In Hibernate, the persistence context is represented by org.hibernate. Session instance,
 where pC in javax.persistence is represented by javax.persistence.EntityManager,
 - When we use Hibernate as a JPA provider and operate via EntityManager interface,
 the implementation of this interface basically wraps the underlying Session object.

 * it allows communication between application and the database,

 * we create transactions using session object,

MORE ADVANCED:

 * SessionFactory should create a new session for each thread,

 * is single threaded, so we should create a new session object for each thread,

 * it stores the data that we used in our transactions,

ACTIONS:

 * when you close a session then all instances are pushed to the repo,
