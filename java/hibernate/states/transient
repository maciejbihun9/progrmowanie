 * object that I so not want to be touched by hibernate,

 * newly created instance object,

 * a transient object can be created with a new keyword,
 but this kind of object is not associated with a session,

 * in normal java world this kind of object can be considered
 as not to be serialized, but in jpa this means that we do not want to store
 our objects in the database,
