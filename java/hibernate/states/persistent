 * contains id and database representation,

 * the object is considered as a persistent between session.save() and session.close(),

 * each change to the persistent object will be saved after session close() or after each flush() method call,

 * after session.delete() the object will be in Transient state, but after save() it will back to the persistent state,

 * each change between those two method calls will be saved into the database,

 * the object becomes persistent when I ask hibernate to manage that object, to save him,

 * hibernate will track entity changes,
