 * if I load an entities to a persistence context with all properties
 and then change only one property in one entity then hibernate still checks all entities
 and call update on all that have changed

 * automatic dirty checking - scanning for changed entities and committing only those which were updated,
 At the end of a transaction hibernate will search for updated values, aquire lock on tables and updates entities
 ending a transaction
