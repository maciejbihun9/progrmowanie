 * make sure that you load the data in Transactional context:
 - use @transactional annotation to do it,

 * use EntityGraph to do it,
 - but make sure that an object really will have many of objects, because otherwise i can load that eagerly

 worth to know:
 * hibernate loads lazy collection when I stop on debug point in transactional method,
 but when I do it without debug point in that method I will get lazy initialization exception,
