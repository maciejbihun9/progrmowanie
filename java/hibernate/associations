MANY TO MANY:

 * each @ManyToMany association will create another table in the database with
 ids of selected tablse,

 * this new table will have two primarykeys

ONE TO ONE:

 * it has to be an association between those two entities (cascade = CascadeType.ALL),
 because we have to have bidirectional association,

 * The bidirectional associations should always be updated on both sides,
 therefore the Parent side should contain the addChild and removeChild combo.
 These methods ensure we always synchronize both sides of the association,
 to avoid object or relational data corruption issues,
