 * it is associated with too many queries, because of FETCH.LAZY,

 * when you try to get the data that is annotated as lazy then you will
 face quering the database everytime that causes n+1 problem,

 examples:
 * this query will end up with many database queries if you use FETCHTYPE.LAZY for
 your associations
 - List<Order> orders = em.createQuery("SELECT o FROM Order o").getResultList();
   for (Order order : orders) {
       log.info("Order: " + order.getOrderNumber());
       log.info("Number of items: " + order.getItems().size());
   }

 resolutions:
 * example resolution using convenient query:
  - List<Person> personList = session.createQuery("SELECT DISTINCT p FROM Person p JOIN FETCH p.agreements").list();

 * we have a list of cars and each car has a list of wheels.
 We want to print all cars and all wheels for each car.
 - get all wheels ordered by carId - this would give us very nice and quick way to manage all items,
 - get all cars ordered by carId - all cars
