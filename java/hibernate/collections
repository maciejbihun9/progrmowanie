SORTED COLLECTION:

 * When use sorting, Hibernate will load the associated Book entities
 from the database and use a Java Comparator to sort them in memory.
 That is not a good approach for huge Sets of entities.

ORDER COLLECTION:

 * Ordering uses an ORDER BY clause in the SQL statement to retrieve the entities in the defined order.
 Database handles these kinds of operations very efficiently. So this approach is a lot better for huge associations,
