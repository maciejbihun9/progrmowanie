 * place this code in the @Before annotated method:
 - place scripts/data-h2.sql in the resources folder,
 - Resource initData = new ClassPathResource("scripts/data-h2.sql");
   DatabasePopulator databasePopulator = new ResourceDatabasePopulator(initData);
   DatabasePopulatorUtils.execute(databasePopulator, testDataSource);

 thoughts:
 - this is much more time consuming task than creating the database using java and init loader,
 - creating sql queries you have to remember about that you have to store values
 with convenient type, because you will face serialization problem instead (BigDecimal, LocalDataTime)
