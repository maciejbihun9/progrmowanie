 * mocking makes viewing nested objects very hard,
 - it is tough to look into nested collections and see what is there
 and it is hard to investigate what went wrong in a test
 - having a constructor in a model class makes harder to test, because
 you have to provide all dependencies for tests,
 - if there is a lot of dependencies then there will be a lot of code to write

 * having setter methods really allows easier testing,

 * do not test very easy code, it is very cost process,
