 worth to know:

 * it buffers data through the first subscription,
 it replays the data to all subscribers that comes later,

 * it does not matter when we subscribe, because we will receive
 broadcasted items from a buffer,

 implementation:

 * connect:
 - connects to a source when this method is called and the data is pushed
 to all subscribers
 - when a new subscriber shows up then buffered data is sent to that subscriber,

 * autoConnect(n):
 - connects to a source when there is enough number of subscribers,

 * refCount(n):
 - tracks when a subscription is cancelled and if there is no enough
 subscriptions then pushing stops for given amount of time
 before disconnecting this source,

 use cases:

 * broadcast items to subscribers,
