 * BehaviorSubject:
 - this is an observable, allows emitting events

 * Observer:
 - onNext(): that is called after each item goes to a observer,
 so that I can perform some action for each event,
 - onComplete(): called when we get all events or items and I do not
 expect any more items coming to our observer.
 - onError()

 * Subscription:
 - is created when we subscribe to an observable,

 * Observable:
 a) non-blocking observable:
 - you have to request async execution on a different thread
 - here we can unsubscribe normally,

 b) blocking:
 - the execution will be synchromus,so all execution will be
 invoked on a thread that invoked an action,
 - it is not possible to unsubscribe that observable,

 * Schedulers:
 - provide a way to specify on which thread we want to execute our code,
 - we have to specify that to set on which thread we want to run
 our application,

 implementation:

 * create an observable:
 - Observable.from(iterable)
