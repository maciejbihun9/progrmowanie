 worth to know:
 * we do not end up with empty collection !!! GREAT,

 * buffering is similar to windowing
 instead of emitting windows (Flux<T>) it emits buffers (Collection<T>),

 * when our buffer is opened we are adding new items to a collection
 and when it is closed we emit it,

 * everything is the same but just we are sending collections instead of flux

 implementation:

 * Flux.range(1, 10).buffer(5, 3)

 * bufferWhile:
 - do not return empty collections - GREAT
