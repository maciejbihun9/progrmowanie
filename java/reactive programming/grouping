 worth to know:

 * once a source produce a new key, then items that match that key
 goes to that group,

 * several groups may be opened in the same time,

 * even if we have many groups we want to have a flat stream that we
 can send to subscribers,

 use cases:

 * depending on a value we can group items:
 - a subscriber will receive group after group after group,
 - Flux.just(1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13)
           .groupBy(i -> i % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd")
           // combine all groups together
           .concatMap(g -> g.defaultIfEmpty(-1) //if empty groups, show them
                           .map(String::valueOf) //map to string
                           .startWith(g.key()))
