 * we can aggregate the data in: String, StringBuilder etc.

 * scanning maybe used also for simple accumulation:
 - Observable.from(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4)).scan((integer, integer2) -> {
               return integer * integer2;
           });

 * appending items to specified container:
 - next item is added to previous item
 - Observable.from(DataGenerator.generateGreekAlphabet())
                   // first item - a container in which we want to aggregate all items,
                   // second item - already accumulated value,
                   // third item - next item that wew want to add to our final buffer
                   .scan(new StringBuilder(), (accumBuffer, nextLetter) -> {

                       return accumBuffer.append(nextLetter);
                   })
                   .subscribe((total) -> {
                       System.out.println("Scan Event: " + total.toString());
                   });
