 * for making http requests to webflux rest api,
 - this works pretty similar to a html app that is able to consume flux streams,

 * simple rest client is able to make a request for reactive data,
 only the right implementation can do that,

 * uses reactor and netty,

 * it is non-blocking,

 * an alternative to a rest template,

 * it is used for making requests,

 implementation:

 use cases:

 * send multipart data, files, multivalue maps,

 * change a response type from normal to Flux or Mono:
 - having Flux type here we asure that we can consume stream that sits under specified url
 - webClient
       .get()
       .retrieve()
       .bodyToFlux(Product.class)
       .doOnNext(o -> System.out.println("**********GET: " + o));
