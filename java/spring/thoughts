 * sometimes after some changes (added deps, controllers) applications
 just stops working and throwing not really informative exceptions,
 - javax/servlet/ServletContext class not found - there is no
 too much information about that issue in the internet,

 * just see if everything is ok with the application after every little change,
 - every piece of stuff is so important!!!,

 * before you decide to do something, check path that should work
 for any little errors (IT IS VERY IMPORTANT)
