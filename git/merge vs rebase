MERGE:

 * merge is more safe than rebase, because it maintains state of a branch
 instead of connecting all of it in one branch,

REBASE:

 * rewrite all changes from specified branch to current branch:
 we lost unique branch history.
 - git rebase branch_name

 * The major benefit of rebasing is that you get a much cleaner project history,

 * it creates much cleaner project history,

 * rebasing loses the context provided by a merge commit,
