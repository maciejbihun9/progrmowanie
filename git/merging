 * merge two branches:
 - go to branch to which all changes should be merged
 - git merge branch_name

 * branch rebasing:
 - it is very interesting replacement for simple merging,
 - creates clear history, user feels like there were no additional branches,
 - admin will not be forced to integrate all changes with master branch,
